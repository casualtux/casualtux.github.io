<p>Casual Tux is all about the Linux culture.
<br>The Linux culture is all about openess.  We want to be open as well.
<br>But we are dealing with images, so how do we do that?
<p>All Casual Tux images are created using an SVG format.  This is a vector based way of creating pictures.  In short, each line is a description of going from point a to point b.  This is very much like the code that creates a program.
<br>So we are releasing our graphics as if the svg files are code, and any png or jpg files as compiled code, or binaries.
<p>More information and details are to come.
