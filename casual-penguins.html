Casual Penguins
</h1>
<p>With three different Casual Tux's, each with their own variations, I wanted more variations in my pattern.  The first was a more complex pattern, called Four Square.  But then I wanted something more simple.  
<br>What could be more simple than three penguins sitting, being casual.
